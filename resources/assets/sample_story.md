While opening one of the Angel Houses, I met a little girl named Kittu. She is only 4 years old. Kittu was orphaned at age three when her mom died of a disease and her dad who was deaf and mute couldnâ€™t take care of her. My heart broke for this little girl as I spent time with her and learned about her story. I spent significant time with her each of the three visits we made to the Angel House. I played games with her and helped her open her gifts graciously provided by the home sponsors.

Among the other twenty-five children at this Angel House is another little boy named Mahesh, who is also 4 years old. His active personality caught my attention right away. He was orphaned shortly after his dad went to prison and his mom abandoned him. Unfortunately, his story is not uncommon.
