I want to share some exciting news with you regarding an incredible opportunity I have next summer. I am joining a passionate team of fellow missionaries for a life-altering short-term trip. We will be in country for a nine days focused on evangelism, medical outreach, well building, leadership conferences and more! The government and local leaders are open and ready for our team. I have felt a compassion for the lost and broken for some time now and believe this is the first step in my calling to the nations of the world. This is sure to be an unforgettable experience.

In preparation for departure, I am seeking support, both financially and in prayer. I need to raise funding to make my trip possible. Will you consider a gift of $100, $50 or $25 or more to make my dream a reality?

I appreciate your consideration of support. I sincerely appreciate your prayerful consideration in helping make this trip possible.
