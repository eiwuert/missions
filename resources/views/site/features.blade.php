				<h4>Crafted for World Changers</h4>
				<p>The completely redesigned Missions.Me has not only been given a fresh look but it has been carefully crafted to empower you with new features and reengineered tools you already know and love.</p>

				<h4>Mobile Love</h4>
				<p>With nearly 50% of our users accessing Missions.Me on a phone, we’ve worked hard to improve the mobile experience. One way we’ve changed things is with a reimagined navigation bar ideal for smaller devices.</p>

				<h4>Step by Step</h4>
				<p>Committing to help change the world is not something to be taken lightly; neither was redesigning the trip registration process. We’ve simplified it into a series of steps, with informative prompts, and the opportunity to review your reservation before finalizing your transaction.</p>

				<h3 class="text-primary dash-trailing">New Features</h3>

				<h4>Introducing the Dashboard</h4>
				<p>The dashboard is your new best friend. Each time you log into your account, you’ll be able see the most import things right away. Quickly browse upcoming deadlines, recent donations, and important announcements.</p>

				<h4>Manage your Family’s Reservations</h4>
				<p>Easily register and manage not only your own trip reservations but also your family members’ or friends’ reservations using your own personal account.</p>

				<h4>Reusable Travel Documents</h4>
				<p>Travel documents like Passports, Visas, etc. can be managed using the new records screen in your dashboard. Create and edit the whole family’s or group’s set of documents and then quickly “attach” them to a travel requirement on each reservation.</p>

				<h4>Share Stories</h4>
				<p>Both individuals and groups now have the ability to post updates and stories directly on their public profiles or fundraisers. Keep your supporters informed with a quick update or growth your support base by telling your world changing story.</p>

				<h4>Customizable Fundraisers</h4>
				<p>We understand how important raising funds for your trip or project is, so we’ve put even more control in your hands. Customize your page’s url, show or hide the donors list, and add as many pictures and videos as you want!</p>

				<h4>Detailed Cost Breakdown and Payment Tracking</h4>
				<p>Staying on top of deadlines and knowing exactly where your funds are going is easier with an improved cost breakdown and clear payment balance tracking.</p>
